# Product_Defects_ML_Engineering

### Introduction
Welcome to the "Understanding and Simulating the Poisson(7) Distribution" project. In this project, you will explore and gain insights into the Poisson distribution, particularly when it has a rate parameter (λ) equal to 7. The Poisson distribution is a fundamental probability distribution often used in various fields, including quality control and reliability analysis. It models the number of events occurring within a fixed interval of time or space. [Let's get started](Product_Defects.ipynb)

### Project Overview
As part of your role, you are responsible for monitoring the number of defects in products coming from a specific factory. You've been informed that the number of defects on a given day follows the Poisson distribution with a rate parameter (λ) equal to 7. This means that, on average, you expect to see 7 defects per day.

### Objectives
Understanding the Poisson(7) Distribution:

Learn the fundamentals of the Poisson distribution.
Understand that the rate parameter (λ) represents the expected value of the distribution, which, in this case, is 7 defects per day.
Investigating Distribution Attributes:

Explore the characteristics and attributes of the Poisson(7) distribution.
Gain an intuition for the distribution's behavior, including the likelihood of observing different numbers of defective objects in a given amount of time.
Simulating Data:

Practice and apply your knowledge of the Poisson distribution by simulating data.
Create a practice dataset that mimics the real-world scenario you are monitoring.

### Dependencies
This project relies on the following Python libraries:

NumPy
Matplotlib (for data visualization)
Jupyter Notebook

### Contributions
Contributions to this project are welcome! If you have ideas for improvements or additional analyses, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

### Acknowledgments
This project was inspired by the need to understand and work with the Poisson distribution in real-world scenarios.
